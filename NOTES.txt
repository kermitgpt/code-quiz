- Homework 4

-- Need to create structure for 3 types of pages
    -- Quiz start page (where user presses "Start Quiz")
    -- Question page (will cycle through same format for each question page for quiz)
    -- Initials page (submit)
    -- Highscore page (logs all highscores w/ initials user entered.) Option to start quiz again


HTML:
-- Provide basic format for each page:
    -- 



-- Array of question objects
    -- Come up with theme I want to do for quiz, it can be anything
    -- Multiple choice (4) options for answers to each question


-- use .hide() to hide specific questions, then .show() once user has answered each question

-- Array of answer objects?
    -- Link this to the question objects, display 4 multiple choice options for each
    --Reference 05-third-party-apis #09



-- User local storage to store initials and user score


 - Need a timer to start when quiz starts, for timer to count down and ADD time if answer is correct while SUBTRACT time if answer is wrong.
    --setIntervalTimer



-- At the top of the application get local storage. If it doesn't exist create variable to save it. (Start with an empty array at the top?)

-- when user puts in initials thats when we add it to the array, putting it into the empty array that is created in it's place
