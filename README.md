## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

In this project I created a quiz according to the assignment instructions of:

1. Having a start page and clicking to start
2. Quiz questions popping up on screen with multiple choice answers
3. Timer counting down while taking quiz, adding time for correct answers and subtracting time for incorrect answers
4. Scoreboard (called it Leaderboard on mine) for tracking initials & scores of players in local storage

For the quiz content I chose one of my all-time favorite video games: Rocket League.

Hope you enjoy the quiz, and good luck!
